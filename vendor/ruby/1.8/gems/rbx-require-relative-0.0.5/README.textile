h2. Ruby 1.9's relative_relative for Rubinus and MRI 1.8

Here we add in Module RequireRelative method: *require_relative*, and *abs_file*. Example:

bc. require 'rubygems'; require 'require_relative'
require_relative './lib/foo' 
absolute_path = RequireRelative.abs_file

But why *abs_file*? Well, recall that ==__FILE__== does not give an absolute path. So if you have chdir'd before using ==__FILE__==, you might not be able to retrieve the full path.
