0.0.5  (06-12-11) Fleetwood release

Allow this to work on Ruby MRI 1.8 and 1.9. On 1.9 we don't do
anything for require_relative, but in 1.9.2+thread_frame we add a
relible abs_path.  This package is provided on 1.9 is there for
compatibility and for abs_path for a threadframe-enabled 1.9.2.

On MRI abs_path may be unreliable in the face of Dir.chdir.


0.0.4  (04-22-11)

- Using an undocumented API has changed in Rubinius 1.2.4dev.  Down
  the line, we need to get an API for RequireRelative#abs_file in
  Rubinius.  Until then, we'll have to change code.

0.0.3  (09-27-10)

- Small .gemspec packaging issues

0.0.2  (09-22-10)

- First public release.
